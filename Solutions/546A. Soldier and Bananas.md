## Problem: 546A. Soldier and Bananas

### 📜 Description
A soldier wants to buy `w` bananas.  
The first banana costs `k` dollars, the second costs `2k`, the third `3k`, and so on.  
He has `n` dollars.  
Determine how much money he needs to borrow to buy all `w` bananas.

### 🧩 Constraints
- `1 <= k, n, w <= 1000`

---

## 💡 Idea
- Total cost = `k × (1 + 2 + ... + w)`  
- Use arithmetic progression: `sum = w × (w + 1) / 2`
- Multiply by `k`
- If `n >= total` → print `0`  
- Else → print `total - n`

---

## 🧱 Code (C++)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int k, n, w;
    cin >> k >> n >> w;

    int total = k * w * (w + 1) / 2;
    cout << max(0, total - n) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## ⏱️ Complexity

- Time: O(1)
- Space: O(1)

## 🧠 Key Tricks
- Arithmetic progression: sum = w(w+1)/2
- max(0, ...) → avoids negative output
- No loops, no extra memory

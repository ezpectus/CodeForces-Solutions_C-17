## Problem: 791A. Bear and Big Brother

### 📜 Description
Limak the bear weighs `a` kilograms. His brother Bob weighs `b` kilograms.  
Each year:
- Limak triples his weight (`a *= 3`)
- Bob doubles his weight (`b *= 2`)

Determine the **minimum number of years** until Limak becomes strictly heavier than Bob.

---

### 🧩 Constraints
- `1 <= a <= b <= 10`
- Both weights are integers

---

## 💡 Idea
- Simulate year-by-year growth
- Loop until `a > b`
- Count number of iterations

---

## 🧱 Code (C++)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;

    int years = 0;
    while (a <= b) {
        a *= 3;
        b *= 2;
        years++;
    }

    cout << years << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
## ⏱️ Complexity

- Time: O(log b) — exponential growth
- Space: O(1)

## 🧠 Key Tricks

- Direct simulation → no math needed
- Loop until condition flips
- Minimal branching
